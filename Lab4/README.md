# Lab 4 - Docker Container part 2

## Goal

In the previous lab, you deployed the container manually but it would be awesome if we could automate the process so each time you'd checkin a code update, Azure DevOps would compile the code, deploy it to a container and push it to Azure Container Registry (ACR) automatically.  Like in the previous lab, the Web App will be updated using a Webhook. 

Magical! To do so, let's start by creating a new pipeline.

## Let's code!

### Create a new pipeline

Head to dev.azure.com, click on the **Pipelines** menu and the **New Pipeline** button.

![01][01]


Click on the **Use the Visual Designer** link.

![02][02]


Select **Azure Repos Git** and the team project you created earlier.

![03][03]


Select the **Docker Container template**.  This template has 2 steps that needs to be configured: Build and Push.

![04][04]


### Configure the Build step

Let's configure the Build step.  Select your **subscription** and your **Azure Container Registry**.  

![05][05]


Locate the **Dockerfile** in your project.

![06][06]


### Configure the Push step

Let's now configure the Push step that will push the container to ACR.  Click on the **Push an Image** step.

![07][07]


Select your **subscription** and your **Azure Container Registry**.  Check **Include Latest Tag**.

![08][08]


Click on **Save**.  Youâ€™ll be prompted for a location in your repo, accept the defaults and click **Save**.

![09][09]


### Enable continuous integration

Click on the **Triggers** tab and check **Enable continuous integration**.

![10][10]


### Configure the Web App

Head to the Azure portal and locate the Web App you created in the previous lab.  We will change the container settings to point to the  container created by the pipeline.

Click on the **Container Settings** link. Change the container name to the one located in the Azure Container Registry (the one that was just built by the pipeline).  Change the startup file to **GABCDemo.dll**.  

Set **Continuous Deployment** to On.  This will create a Webhook to the container.  Now on, when an updated version of the container is pushed to ACR, the Web App will automatically pull the new container.


### Test the Web App

Launch a browser and test the app.


### Commit a change

Back in **Code**, make a simple change to the Home controller. Don't forget to save your work.

Next, do a git commit, and a git push. You can do it directly from the terminal or from Code.

Head now to Azure DevOps and open the pipeline we just created (don't edit it).  Notice that it will pick the code change automatically, create a container and deploy it to ACR.  The Web App will pick the change using the Webhook and pull the new container.  Wicked!


### Cleaning up resources

We are done using the containers. If you want, you can delete everything by deleting your resource group:

```bash
az group delete --name GAB2019Group
# Enter 'y' to confirm
```

Or if you prefer to keep you other resources but only want to delete your running container, you can:

```bash
az container delete --resource-group GAB2019Group --name gab2019container
# Enter 'y' to confirm
```

Then you can list the running containers to make sure it has been deleted:

```bash
az container list --resource-group GAB2019Group --output table
```
